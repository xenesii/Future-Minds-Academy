        <h3>Native Peoples</h3>
        <br>
        <p>When Europeans arrived , the area was 
            inhabited by the Tonkawa tribe . Comanches and Lipan
            Apaches also traveled in the region . Though they
            <br>
            came into contact with Spanish explorers and missions,
            few settlements were established for several centuries.

<h3>Geographic Distinction</h3><br>
<p>Austin is situated at the foot of the Balcones
    Escarpment , a long stable and inactive fault line ,
    on the Colorado River. This fault divides the Hill <br>
    Country to the West of Austin from the prairie land
    to the East . <br>
